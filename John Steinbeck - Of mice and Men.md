Story is about two friends(perhaps friends, that wasn't revealed in a book), one is extremely strong, tall and big(**Lenny**), and one is just a small guy(**George**). Those two friends are going to a farm where they further will work.

Books is built on the fact that Lenny has some kind of intellectual disability, he isn't psycho, he just thinks and behaves as a child. His biggest dream is having rabbits and looking after them.

Lenny likes to **շոյել փափուկ բաներ**,   he has been playing with small mice lots of times, but always killed them by accident. They were fired from the previous farm because Lenny liked the dress of one of the girls from farm owners family , and just wanted to շոյել the dress, girl started to scream Lenny got scared and started pulling the dress stronger. They ran out from that farm. 

George is a great guy in my opinion, he took full responsibility for Lenny, and always protected him. 

They have a big dream, buying a house where they will have rabbits, pigs, cows, and won't have a boss, they will work as much as they want, they'll do all they won't and enjoy their life. Lenny always asks George to tell him about his favorite part, how he is gonna let Lenny feed and play with rabbits. 

When they get to work, they meet owners son(Кудряш). He is a boxer with small body and an evil guy, he treats all the workers very bed. He has a wife, as the workers joke half the day Кудряш is tying to find his wife, second half his wife is searching for him. His wife constantly goes to the workers room, and tries to have a conversation with them, that's why all the workers thing of the as a slut.

Workers :

- Ловкач - Best worker, he is a kind guy and is respected by everyone
- Липкий - Old guy, he has lost his arm while working in the farm, and got 200$ for that.
- Крючок - Nigger, leaves alone, doesn't speak with anyone( cause that's old America)
- Rest of the workers aren't important

George has told to Lenny, this phrase which is pretty memorable for me.

 **“Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. . . . With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.” – George**

Not them because they get each other to carry about. 

So in some way Lenny gives meaning to Georges life, and Lenny loves George although he never shows that just because his disabilities I guess. 

First day in the rancho(farm), there happens a thing which is analogy to the end of the book.  Липкий  has a dog, which is very old and smells really bad. Dog can't properly move, see, and the guys complain so much that Липкий agrees to kill the dog. He gets depressed though. 

Very same day  Кудряш seeks out a fight with Lenny, He punches and punches Lenny, but Lenny doesn't kick him back, only in the end George tells Lenny to answer to his punches. Lenny nearly breaks his arm. Then he starts telling that he didn't want to harm, that George made him do it, and gets afraid of the fact that maybe George won't let him look after rabbits. 

Липкий  hears how George and Lenny talk about their future farm and asks to join them, and tells that he got move and can wash dished and work although he is old. So they are very close to thier dream they just need to work for one more month and when they get their salary they'll move to their own house.

Липкий  also tells that he has seen countless guys that would work and in the end of the month just go to a бардель or spend all the money on cards. but our guys are different they got each other to care for.

Oh and Липкий  and Lenny get puppies from  Ловкач, and Lenny spends all the time playing with the puppy.

One day he gets to Крючок's room, and they start talking, turns out that Крючок would love to speak to someone but noone wants it, just like with Кудряш's wife, they are pretty much the same, both are sad because of their loneliness(as later Кудряш's wife tells Lenny, she doesn't love Кудряш ), oh and that time Кудряш's wife enters the room but nigger asks her to leave.

One day all the guys go to bardel(not Lenny and nigger though)

Next day Lenny kills the puppy by accident(he just hitted the poppy slghtly when poppy byted him) and get's worried that George won't let gim play with rabbits. Afterwards Кудряш's wife comes to room(all the guys where playing something outside so they were alone). They have a little talk, Lenny tells how he is gonna feed rabbits and that he likes papuk baner, Кудряш's wife says that she has very soft(hisheci papuk vonc er anglerenov!!!) hair, Lenny touches it, and starts pulling, Кудряш's wife start to scream, he panics that George will hear, tries to shut her up, and breaks his neck, again by accident just because he is extremely strong.

He remembers where George told him to run and hide in case of an emergency. 

Guys come in and see dead body, they don't have any choice so they tell Кудряш and all go to find and kill Lenny. George steals a gun from one of the guys, goes to that place alone and see Lenny.



Lenny starts to apologize and explain everything. George tells that he isn't mad at him and asks to remember that he was never mad at him. Lenny as always asks to tell him the stories. How are they different from other warkers and how beautify they're future is gonna be. 

After that George taqun kills Lenny.

The end.

------

I honestly expected George to commit suicide after killing Lenny, but surprisingly he didn't. 

I don' t really understand that. Sure Кудряш most likely would have found him and killed but although that was like handznveling from George. Maybe he decided that the life of other guys is more preferable. Staying in bardel and drinking by spending all the money. Maybe he xxchac Lenny, but Lenny was happy, so not that one.

Lenny was giving purpose to George life but George just killed his meaning of the life. 

George is a great guy still, he is very kind person just like Lenny was.

Who is the bad here. Let's exclude Кудряш(he is obviously not good). Липкий blamed Кудряш's wife for ruining he's future. Everyone though that Кудряш's wife is a bitch. But what did she really do bad. She was simply unhappy in his marriage. Кудряш doesn't ever care about her, he was just telling everyone how good fighter he is. She got no one to speak to, she refused not becoming an actress. She is like the nigger. She boxoqeled why she can't just talk with them.

Oh when George said that he wouldn't be in such troubles without Lenny,  Lenny always told that if he don't need him, he will go and leave in a пещера. And perhaps nigger told Lenny, that he doesn't do anything for George(desite George dedicates his full life to him). That claim is partially correct.

I'm just interested how will Georges life be now, it might be easier but he just turned to regular worker who no one gives a shit about(sorry for bad word, didn't find a synonym) .

As conclusion No One can blame George for killing Lenny. 

It's important to have someone to care about

If someone acts badly, maybe that's because he/she is very unhappy.

### Quotes

“In every bit of honest writing in the world, there is a base theme. Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. KNOWING A MAN WELL NEVER LEADS TO HATE and nearly always leads to love. There are shorter means, many of them. There is writing promoting social change, writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always that base theme. TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER!”

“A guy needs somebody―to be near him. A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. Don't make no difference who the guy is, long's he's with you. I tell ya, I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he gets sick

“I see hundreds of men come by on the road an’ on the ranches with their bindles on their back an’ that same damn thing in their heads. Hundreds of them. They come, an’ they quit an’ go on; an’ every damn one of ‘em’s got a little piece of land in his head. An’ never a God damn one of ‘em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of books out there. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody never gets no land. It’s just in their head.”

“Ain’t many guys travel around together,” he mused. “I don’t know why. Maybe ever’body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.”

“Well, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy. I just like to know what your interest is.”
